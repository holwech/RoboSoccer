## Git help
#### Don't have the files?
Run `git clone https://github.com/holwech/RoboSoccer`

#### ALWAYS do this BEFORE starting to work on code
`cd` in the console to the RoboSoccer folder and run `git pull`

This updates the code, incase someone else have been working on it since you last were at the lab.

#### ALWAYS do this AFTER you are done working on code
`cd` in the console to the RoboSoccer folder and run

1.`git add .`

2.`git commit -am "Write some message here about what you have done with the code`

3.`git push`

This uploads your changes to github

#### Git is doing/saying things I don't understand
Do not try to fix anything or do random stuff, just ask Joachim or Andreas (The Norwegian Andreas) for help.
