Before running the simulation environment, make sure you have qtcreator installed:
sudo apt-get install qt5-dev qtcreator 

To run the simulation environment:
cd ROSOSIM_FOLDER/usr/script
./team_start.sh

Where ROSOSIM_FOLDER is the folder where this Readme.txt file is found.

If every works well, the green field and the referee GUI windows should be open. If that is the case, you can start qtcreator:

qtcreator ROSOSIM_FOLDER/workspace/soccer_sample.pro

The binaries were compiled in an Ubuntu x86_64 machine.
